        <h1>Creating a Backup (Snapshot)</h1>
        <p>To perform a backup or set-up a backup schedule we need to get to the Volume DB backup page. You can do that by clicking the <b>SETTINGS</b> tab in the System part of the left side-bar.
The first thing in the page is the backup scheduling form itself as in the below picture:

        </p>
        <p>It’s possible to choose:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Snapshot schedule (run now or schedule)</li>
            <li>What to save: single Volume or all Volumes on HyperFile. We can clearly see that snapshots are allowed only for volumes with a versioning-enabled bucket in HyperStore. In this case only “Test2_snapshot” is available. We can still choose another volume but, in this case, snapshot will only perform a database backup without being able to retain corresponding object versions in HyperStore.</li>
            <li>Where to save the snapshot (= database). We can use separate devices for this.</li>
            <li>How many snapshots to keep (see considerations on space usage). Up to 99.</li>
            <li>If snapshot image (database copy) is saved into object storage.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Also, make sure the Volume has a tier “object storage level” or snapshots won’t work!</p>
        <p>Fill out the form according to you needs and click <b>Apply</b> to perform/schedule the backup.</p>

        <p>All schedules and backups will appear below the form:</p>
