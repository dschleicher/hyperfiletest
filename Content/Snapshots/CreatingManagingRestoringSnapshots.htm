        <h1>Creating, Managing, and Restoring Snapshots</h1>
        <p>Let’s look at how the feature is implemented and how to use it. 
<b>The volume(s) that we want to backup need to have an object storage tier configured (a bucket on HyperStore with versioning enabled)</b>. 
In addition, only data that is already in HyperStore will be included in the snapshot. So, any file that is still only in disk won’t be included in that specific snapshot. 
Please refer to product Installation or Administration Guides for details on how to configure a volume with object storage tier.
