        <h1>Document Overview</h1>
        <p>This document provides information about the HyperFile Data Protection (“backup”) capabilities describing the concepts and usage of the Snapshots mechanism. 
Beside general concepts there is a description on how this functionality is implemented in current HyperFile release (3.2.x). The mechanism might slightly change and will be subject to improvements in subsequent releases, but the base concepts will still be valid.
