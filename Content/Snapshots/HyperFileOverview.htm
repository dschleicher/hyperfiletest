        <h1>HyperFile Overview</h1>
        <p>In a nutshell, HyperFile is a scale-out NAS platform that provides filesystem protocols for clients and transparent data tiering to object storage (Cloudian HyperStore).  Data is written by applications / clients on HyperFile and then it takes care about managing the underlying tiers of storage, leveraging its ILM capabilities. </p>
        <p>IMAGE-1</p>
        <p>It can be deployed as a stand-alone node or as an HA pair and provides several capabilities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data caching (multiple levels of disk) and tiering to HyperStore</li>
            <li>ILM engine and Data Tiering / Migration</li>
            <li>WORM (including other features like Audit, etc… for Compliance)</li>
            <li>Bi-modal access to data (directly read via S3 in object storage)</li>
            <li>Integrated Data Protection via Snapshots</li>
            <li>Multi-site deployments and Geo-Distribution</li>
            <li>AD/LDAP integration and User Quota</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the context of deployment of HyperFile as a NAS interface for HyperStore, the architecture and the data ingestion workflow can be summarized in the following diagram:</p>
        <p>IMAGE-2</p>
        <p>Thus, we do need to provide the following resources to enable successful deployment:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Computing resources to run the HyperFile instance (i.e. the VM)</li>
            <li>One or more disk devices to be used as primary and secondary disk levels</li>
            <li>Access to HyperStore via Http / S3</li>
            <li>The proper HyperFile product licenses (based on features and data capacity)</li>
            <li>(optional) In case of HA implementations a shared disk resource to be used as common data cache by the two HA nodes (Active / Passive implementation)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A full product description is out of scope of this document, but more information can be found in product specifications and datasheets.</p>
