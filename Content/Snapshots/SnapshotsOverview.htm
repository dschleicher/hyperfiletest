        <h1>HyperFile Data Protection and Snapshots Overview</h1>
        <p>HyperFile provides a powerful and flexible NAS solution that can be used in many scenarios, typically as a NAS interface for HyperStore. Typical use cases include NAS consolidation with use of Object Storage (HyperStore) as shared, scalable and flexible data repository. 

</p>
        <p>This solution by itself provides a very robust data integrity mechanism (both in HyperFile and in HyperStore) but doesn’t cover for human error and/or the need to keep many versions of the same file and make them available to users. </p>
        <p> 

Differently from traditional environments, running application-based backup installing agents on every host using HyperFile as NAS can be cumbersome and hard to maintain. Not to mention that once data is moved to HyperStore (= no more in disk cache), it’s necessary to recall files from HyperStore to HyperFile to back them up. 

</p>
        <p>To solve this problem, HyperFile introduced a powerful Snapshot engine that allows to centrally manage all backup regardless of where data is in the storage hierarchy (disk or object storage).
