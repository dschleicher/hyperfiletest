        <h1>Document Overview</h1>
        <p>This guide provides the needed information to successfully deploy Cloudian HyperFile VM and covers the basics of installation and configuration. While the installation part covers specifically the VM deployment, the configuration part is applicable as well to the Appliance version (HFA-xxx). We focus on using GUI. For CLI and other management tools, refer to the product manual. </p>
        <p>This guide doesn’t replace the HyperFile Administrator Guide or the product manuals that provide a product deeper dive. </p>
        <p>This guide is organized in three main sections: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Solution overview and pre-requisites for installation (detailed information in the Appendix A)</li>
            <li>Installation and basic configuration</li>
            <li>Advanced configuration and disk devices managements (Appendix B)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A sample Test Plan is provided in Appendix B.</p>
