        <h1>Available Hypervisors and Platforms<br /></h1>
        <p>For production deployment, the officially supported hypervisor platform is VMware ESXi (5.x / 6.x). The “Installation” part of this guide focuses on ESXi deployment. Once installed, the configuration guidelines apply also to other types of deployment. </p>
        <p>For PoC or personal testing only, VM image is also reported to work out-of-the-box on other VMware products (e.g. Fusion, Player, Workstation). </p>
        <p>VM can also be installed on Virtualbox, and the IllumOS version can be installed on KVM, but installation must be performed manually on these platforms and might require some fine-tuning.</p>
        <p>Other types of deployment: Cloudian HF Appliances or bare-metal deployments are out of the scope of this document. </p>
