        <h1>HyperFile Installation Requirements overview</h1>
        <p>The VM is provided by Cloudian in form of an OVA file. The underlying hardware resources must be made available for installation. Installation pre-requirements are highlighted in this document Appendix A.&#160;  </p>
        <h2>Getting the HyperFile software</h2>
        <p>The main steps to follow are: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Download HyperFile OVA: </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="Indent">
            <p>For existing customer and partners or Cloudian personnel follow the instructions in this KB article (needs a Salesforce account):</p>
            <p>00000414&#160;Cloudian HyperFile Product Package/Documentation Download<br /><a href="https://login.salesforce.com/5015F000000cLnn">https://login.salesforce.com/5015F000000cLnn</a></p>
            <p>For everybody else: please contact a Cloudian representative to get access to the software. </p>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>HyperFile license: HyperFile comes with a pre-configured license that includes 512 GB disk and 512 GB Object Storage tier and unlimited time. For other features a license is needed and can be either generated by Cloudian personnel for PoC / testing or acquired as a part of your software subscription (contact your sales representative for more details). </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Provisioning Resources</h2>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li>Provide ESXi platform: can be a dedicated or share platform. HyperFile is scalable so the amount of resources can really be adjusted to real needs. Appendix B provides some rough sizing information as part of the site preparation checklist. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li>Provide disk storage for Data cache and Database. In short there are two types of devices we can present to HyperFile: </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-left: 72pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: circle;">VMDK (that can be anything, but it’s managed by hypervisor so transparent to HyperFile)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: circle;">NAS share</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Note that the OVA come with some devices configured by default. </p>
        <p>These devices are pretty much the bare minimum to ensure HyperFile can work and mostly designed for PoC / Test. For production use, need to be expanded (or new devices added) as described later in this guide.&#160; </p>
        <p>HyperFile allows a lot of flexibility in device configuration so it’s possible to add/modify/resize / depopulate / etc... at almost any time, even in case of mistakes in initial sizing or different workloads. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>A rough sizing for disks is highlighted in Appendix A. </p>
        <p>Cloudian provides a separate sizer for fine-tuning the configuration. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li>Prepare Networking. It’s critical that the proper networks are in place. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Because of the use of hypervisor, there is a lot of flexibility in using VLANs and link aggregation that are completely transparent to HyperFile. Network sizing is out of the scope of this document, but we need to keep in mind following things: </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-left: 72pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: circle;">HyperFile needs to communicate with the Clients /Applications for data I/O (i.e. “Front-end”)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: circle;">HyperFile needs to communicate with the Object Storage (HyperStore in this case) for data I/O (i.e. “Back-end”)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>In small deployments (like PoCs or tests) Front-end and Back-end can be on same network. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-left: 72pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: circle;">(optional) HyperFile needs to communicate with the disks (cache) for data I/O (i.e. “Back-end”) if we use NAS devices as cache. </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: circle;">(optional) HyperFile needs to communicate with its peer in case of HA deployment. In this case the networking gets a bit more complicated (see Appendix A)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li>(optional) Provide HyperStore access.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>HyperFile installation, per se, works even without Object Storage. In this case only disk cache will be used. However, for the completeness of the installation, we do assume that HyperStore is correctly installed and configured and that the following information are available. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-left: 72pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: circle;">HyperStore access URL</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: circle;">One of more buckets to be used by HyperFile</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: circle;">S3 Access credentials (access key / secret key)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
