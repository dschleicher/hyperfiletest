        <h1>Cloudian HyperFile Overview</h1>
        <p>In a nutshell, HyperFile is a scale-out NAS platform that provides filesystem protocols for clients and transparent data tiering to object storage (Cloudian HyperStore).  Data is written by applications / clients on HyperFile and then it takes care about managing the underlying tiers of storage, leveraging its ILM capabilities. </p>
        <p>

 












It can be deployed as a stand-alone node or as an HA pair and provides several capabilities:
</p>
        <ul>
            <li> 
Data caching (multiple levels of disk) and tiering to HyperStore 
</li>
            <li>ILM engine and Data Tiering / Migration
</li>
            <li>WORM (including other features like Audit, etc… for Compliance)
</li>
            <li>Bi-modal access to data (directly read via S3 in object storage)
</li>
            <li>Integrated Data Protection via Snapshots
</li>
            <li>Multi-site deployments and Geo-Distribution
</li>
            <li>AD/LDAP integration and User Quota

</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the context of deployment of HyperFile as a NAS interface for HyperStore, the architecture and the data ingestion workflow can be summarized in the following diagram: 

 

Thus, we do need to provide the following resources to enable successful deployment: 

•	Computing resources to run the HyperFile instance (i.e. the VM)
•	One or more disk devices to be used as primary and secondary disk levels
•	Access to HyperStore via Http / S3
•	The proper HyperFile product licenses (based on features and data capacity)
•	(optional) In case of HA implementations a shared disk resource to be used as common data cache by the two HA nodes (Active / Passive implementation)

A full product description is out of scope of this document but more information can be found in product specifications and datasheets.
